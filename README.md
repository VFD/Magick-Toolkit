# Magick-PowerShell Toolkit

## Overview
This project provides a set of **PowerShell scripts (.ps1)** to automate image processing tasks using **ImageMagick**.  
The goal is to simplify batch operations such as resizing, DPI normalization, canvas adjustment, renaming, and PDF generation.

**Why?**  
When working with large sets of images, manual adjustments are time-consuming.  
These scripts allow you to standardize dimensions, resolution, and naming conventions, making it easier to prepare images for printing, archiving, or PDF export.


Work in progress.
